# What is Banglish?
> Banglish is a term used to describe a way of texting or writing in Bangla using the English alphabet.

This is a prime example of transliteration. For example, the Bangla word "আমরা" (meaning "we" in English) is written as "amra" in Banglish.

Though it may not be an official writing system for Bangla, it's still very popular in casual and informal online communication. Instead of adopting a whole different keyboard layout and getting used to the letters people have just adapted the English qwerty to express their feelings in Bangla productively. We are able to get our message across without breaking our fingers trying to find হসন্ত in the keyboard. Since it isn't an official writing system, there aren't any official rules for *Banglish*. But I feel like people should be guided in the right direction when it comes to using *Banglish*. People often get some words completely wrong creating confusion. That's the reason this website exists and if someone sent this with they are probably annoyed with your wrong Banglish.\
Trust me. When you don't get *Banglish* right nobody will come forward and call you out for it but they will surely laugh behind your back. Needless to say, improper *Banglish* indicates ক্ষেতness. It's like not brushing your teeth or not showering or having your zipper down or something. Without *Banglish* your life is incomplete. Since there was no centralised resource to learn this system from, you can't really blame yourself for this. You just copied someone else. Fear not! You can now learn everything you need to know to text in *Banglish* and you will be able to save yourself from any further embarrasment.
