# How to Learn and Practise Banglish
## Learning to Enunciate
As the biggest problem when it comes to Banglish is the lack of enunciation. This is also the easiest to fix. You'll notice the improvements pretty easily. Firstly, let's try going through the easier words.

This example is interesting because both চ‍্ and ছ are responsible for the ch sound. That's just how Bangla works. If you try to fit the independent pronounciation of letters into words they won't make any sense. In this very example, a is pronounced as [আ] instead of [এ] which is similar to how we pronounce a independently. 
> Pro Tip: Though We mostly use [a] for the sound [আ] in Banglish [a] is also used as [অ] in some cases. Especially in names.
Now try and re-explore the relation between the letters in the English alphabet and bangla sounds to correct your Banglish.
## Using unsused letters
People forget to use very important vowels and consonants in Banglish. Banglish is versatile. You can write pretty much any Bangla word with it. Though it may be hard to read but it doesn't matter as this is only used for conversations and you'll hardly ever have to use hard words. But to fully express your feelings you must get used to the rather unorthodox letters. For example, when you try to stress something you would generally add an [ই] at the end of the word. People mistakenly use e instead of i here. This is what they write

A noticeable error in everyone's Banglish is the low usage of [h]. [h] works silently to differentiate words as well as introduce clarity in the text. in the আচ্ছা example people often leave out the [h] and just write acca. This is obviously wrong. There are other examples of people confusing [w] and [y]. If you are able to properly use the letters mentioned above you're about 80% there!
## Practising Methods
You can practise by talking with people. I use avro keyboard to write Banglish to Bangla in default. That is the best way to practise and also see if you're in the right track by checking the words generated from the Banglish. I have also started making digital academic notes in Banglish for extra productivity and ease of searching. I have to be extra careful to be strict with the loose Banglish rules. You don't have to make notes in Banglish though. Just keep practising and you will get there sooner or later.

Lastly, I would like to remind you that Banglish is not to be taken too seriously. Have fun with it. Whoever invented this is a genius. But you won't be putting it to good use of you're not making any sense at all.
