# Common Mistakes People Make when Writing Banglish

## No Enunciation

Enunciation is a big part of writing Banglish correctly. As mentioned previously, it is not an official writing system so there is a lot of room for subjective spelling. But it still has to make sense. People tend to use the same letter combinations for vastly different syllables creating the confusion in the first place. The main culprit here(alongside many) is the lack of enunciation. People don't try to sound out the words they are writing down. Connecting the sounds of the English syllables with the Bangla syllables is the main goal here. It's not the letters that need to sound the same, it's the syllables.

## Copying Bad Banglish
Some unlucky individuals have to consume objectively bad Banglish. It's not their fault they have to endure that. They start to copy that and slowly that turns into the new norm. On the other hand, people with good Banglish knowledge can also improve the others Banglish skills.

## Unnecessary Omissions
Banglish is not a native writing system. Therefore, when people omit important vowels and sometimes consonants the whole sentence becomes incomprehensible. For example, writing "kmn" instead of kemon(কেমন) might make sense in some instances given the context. But it gets tough when you continue to do this and people have to context to figure the words out of. Furthermore, this also shows incompetence and unprofessionalism as Banglish is getting slowly adopted into the corporate pseudoformal conversations.
